### Summary

* This is a utilitarian, nasty sandbox to test concepts.

### Setup

* in parent dir: `ng new sandbox`

```
ng generate component players
ng generate component player
ng serve
npm install --save bootstrap@3
    - edit angular.json and add `bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css`
```

### TODO

x - Admin should have a Config object
x - reflect admin value in console log ?
* Admin fires event on changes to `maxFoos` but it seems like a kludge
* click on Foo item should go to an edit page
