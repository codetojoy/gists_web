* creating chart
    - object-based

        - cannot be serialized
        - data is always serialized
    - JSON-based
        - serialized config (e.g. database)
* series
    - dataFields
        - schema for the series
        - e.g. PieSeries defines 'value' and 'category'
        - each chart type has its own schema
* external data
    - instead of 'data', use 'dataSource'
